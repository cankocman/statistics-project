## ðŸ“˜ About

This repository contains a statistical analysis and simulation project assigned as Homework 1 in the EC233 - Mathematical Statistics I course. The project explores a wide range of statistical, macroeconomic, and probabilistic topics using R Markdown. It demonstrates both theoretical understanding and coding practice through interactive plots, simulations, and comparative economic analysis.

## ðŸ§° How to Use

To reproduce the results:

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ec233-homework1.git
   cd ec233-homework1
   ```

2. **Open `analysis.Rmd` in RStudio** or render it via R:

   ```r
   rmarkdown::render("analysis.Rmd")
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**

   The script automatically installs these if not present:

   ```r
   devtools
   quantmod
   ggplot2
   dplyr
   zoo
   pwt10 (via GitHub)
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Sample Visuals

Here are some of the outputs youâ€™ll see in the HTML report:

- GDP growth comparisons (Turkey vs Poland, Germany vs France)
- Histograms of normally distributed data
- Volatility vs return plots for MSFT and AAPL
- Birthday paradox probability graphs
- Probabilistic election simulations

## ðŸ“Ž Note

- **Dataset sources:** All data is retrieved dynamically via R packages (no external files).
- **No sensitive or large datasets are versioned.** All outputs are reproducible with internet access.
